Kendo is a modern Japanese martial art with roots in the traditional swordmanship of the 
feudal samurai. It reached its contemporary form in the 20th century, during which it also 
began to spread outside of Japan. In Finland kendo has been practiced since 1987.

Kendo is practiced with a flexible bamboo sword called shinai and the strikes and thrusts are 
aimed at specific target areas covered by a protective armour. Kendo as a sport requires 
technical skill rather than muscles and regular practice improves physical fitness, 
coordination and concentration.

Beginners of kendo can find the manner of practice most suited for them through regular 
training and continue to review it as they progress as well as get older. This makes it possible 
for people of all ages to start practicing kendo, from elementary school children to adults. A 
60-year-old kendoka, practitioner of kendo, is no unusual sight at the training. Indeed, kendo 
is well suited for a lifelong activity.
